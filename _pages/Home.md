My name is Felipe Alarcón Peña. 
I’m a Chilean Ph.D candidate at the University of Michigan trying to understand the chemistry in planet-forming disks.
My work is mostly based in hydrodynamics and thermochemical  simulations of disks along with observations of them in the millimetric wavelenghts.

Protoplanetary disks are thought to be the birth places of planets and as such they are very important at constraining their compositions, their origins and whether or not they could be Earth-like or host life as we know it.

Images  from the dust millimetric particles such as the DSHARP Gallery shows that these disk are very rich in substructures, which could be interpreted as potential signpots of ongoing planet formation. Recent images from the MAPS Collaboration show line emission from important gas tracers in five of these disks showing htey have even richer structures across different molecular species, making them interesting objects to study
