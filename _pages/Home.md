My name is Felipe Alarcón Peña. 
I’m a Chilean Ph.D candidate at the University of Michigan trying to understand the chemistry in planet-forming disks.
My work is mostly based in hydrodynamics and thermochemical  simulations of disks along with observations of them in mradio wavelengths with ALMA.

Protoplanetary disks are thought to be the birthplaces of planets and as such they are very important in constraining their compositions, their origins, and whether or not they could be Earth-like or host life as we know it.

Images  from the dust millimetric particles such as the DSHARP Gallery show that these disks are very rich in substructures, which could be interpreted as potential signposts of ongoing planet formation. Recent images from the MAPS Collaboration show line emission from important gas tracers in five of these disks showing they have even richer structures across different molecular species, making them interesting objects to study
