Hello and welcome to my webpage. My name is Felipe Alarcón Peña. I'm a Ph.D candidate at the University of Michigan trying to understand the chemistry in planet-forming disks.

As a Chilean national I enjoy the mountains, homemade fresh bread, latin music, and obviously the clear skies. I'm  also a catlover and a running enthusiast in my free time.

You can find my publications through my ORCID
[0000-0002-2692-7862](https://orcid.org/my-orcid?orcid=0000-0002-2692-7862) or in [ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/filter_database_fq_database=AND&filter_database_fq_database=database%3A%22astronomy%22&fq=%7B!type%3Daqp%20v%3D%24fq_database%7D&fq_database=(database%3A%22astronomy%22)&q=-docs(dc900b9d4c813983b30de4d02b7dec9c)%20%20author%3A%22Alarcon%2C%20Felipe%22&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0) as well.
