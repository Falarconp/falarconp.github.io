Hello and welcome to my webpage. My name is Felipe Alarcón Peña. I'm a Ph.D candidate at the University of Michigan trying to understand the chemistry in planet-forming disks.

As a Chilean national I enjoy the mountains, homemade fresh bread, latin music, and obviously the clear skies. I'm  also a catlover and a running enthusiast in my free time.

You can find my publications through my ORCID
[0000-0002-2692-7862](https://orcid.org/my-orcid?orcid=0000-0002-2692-7862)

In
[ADS](https://orcid.org/my-orcid?orcid=0000-0002-2692-7862) as well.
