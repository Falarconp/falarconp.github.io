Hello and welcome to my webpage. My name is Felipe Alarcón Peña. I’m a Ph.D candidate at the University of Michigan trying to understand the chemistry in planet-forming disks.

As a Chilean national I enjoy the mountains, homemade fresh bread, latin music, and obviously the clear skies. I’m also a catlover and a running enthusiast in my free time.
