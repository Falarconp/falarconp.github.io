Hello and welcome to my webpage. My anem is Felipe Alarcon Pena. I'm a Ph.D candidate at ehe University of Michigan trying to understand the chemistry in planet-forming disks.

As a Chilean national I enjoy the mountains, the bread and latin music, and obviously the clear skies. I'm a catlover and a running enthusiast in my free time.

You can find my publications through my ORCID
