I was borned in Santiago, Chile. I fell in love with the stars there. outside of the capital you can get to observe the clearest skies in the world. Since I was in high school I tried to learn and be invested in astronomical related things. In college i STARTED AS A mECHANICAL engineering major but I decided to switch pushed by the love of the stars and the amazing astornomical facilities and departments in the country.


What really motivated my love for Astronomy is this particularly well-known image of the first protoplanetary disk taken at high spatial resolution with ALMA.

This image of HL tau taken by the ALMA Collaboration convinced to be an astronomer and study planet formation.

As a Chilean national I enjoy the mountains, homemade fresh bread, latin music, and obviously the clear skies. Iâ€™m also a catlover and a running enthusiast in my free time.
