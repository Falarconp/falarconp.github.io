I started studying protoplanetary disk around 2016, right after the amazing image of the HL Tau disk showing all its rich structure with gaps and rings.
Since then, I've been  studying planet formation from different perspectives. I obtained a M.Sc. in Astronomy at Universidad de Chile in 2019 under the supervision of Dr. Sim√≥n Casassus working with rotational line emission features form protoplanetary disks, paritcularly CO isotopologues and hydrodyanmics and radiative transfer simulations.

After my M. Sc. I started a Ph.D in Astronomy at the University of Michigan (where I'm currently at) with Dr. Edwin Bergin. At Umich I have been exploring the different chemical tracers and processes happening in protoplanetary disks through thermochemical simulations and structures around possible protoplanets. I was part of the MAPS collaboration, a Large ALMA Program observing 5 disks in several molecular lines at high spatial resolution (0.1 arcsec). I'm also involved in an ERS program using IR data from JWST observing the Orion bar.
