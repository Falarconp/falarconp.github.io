I started studying protoplanetary disks around 2016, right after the amazing image of the HL Tau disk showing its rich structure with gaps and rings.
Since then, I've been  studying planet formation from different perspectives. I obtained an M.Sc. in Astronomy at Universidad de Chile in 2019 under the supervision of Dr. Simón Casassus and Dr. Sebastián Pérez working with rotational line emission features from protoplanetary disks, particularly CO isotopologues and hydrodynamics, and radiative transfer simulations. 

After my M. Sc. I started a Ph.D. in Astronomy at the University of Michigan with Dr. Ted Bergin. At Umich I have been exploring the different chemical tracers and processes happening in protoplanetary disks through thermochemical simulations and structures around possible protoplanets. I was part of the MAPS collaboration, a Large ALMA Program observing 5 disks in several molecular lines at high spatial resolution (0.1 arcsec). I've also had the luxury of being involved in a JWST-ERS program, PDRs4All, understanding the physics and chemistry in star-forming regions such as  Orion. 

I'm also very interested in understanding planet formation in its early stages. Much of my late efforts have been tailored to try to constrain the observability of protoplanets through millimetric and infrared/optical observations. My final goal is to test such constraints with state-of-the-art observatories and set the stage for upcoming 30m telescopes while imporivng the design of these observational campaigns.
