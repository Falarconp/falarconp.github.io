## Hi, *I'm a 4th year Astronomy PhD student at University of Michigan*. As a Chilean native, I got really interested in the Space Sciences. Right now I'm trying to understand the _astrochemistry in planet formation processes_ and how we create the molecules that will end up allowing the formation of life and planets like the Earth!. In my free time I enjoy running and reading. Also, I'm an occasional baker.
